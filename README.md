This repository constitutes a thesis project, encompassing the Arduino code required for serial communication between an Arduino Uno R3 and SparkFun's CAN Bus Shield with an OBD-II Simulator, 
utilizing the OBD2 library. The code was developed in C++ using Visual Studio Code. Additionally, HTML files were incorporated to design and implement a web-based interface, 
leveraging Googleâ€™s Web Serial API extension. This integration enhances the project's functionality, accessibility, and future scalability, aligning with modern technological advancements.
